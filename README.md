### GPT-3 API Example in Java
This is a simple example of how to use the GPT-3 API in Java to generate text.

### Prerequisites
To use this example, you will need:

A GPT-3 API key. You can get one by signing up for the GPT-3 beta program.
A GPT-3 engine ID. You can create one by going to the API dashboard and following the instructions.
### Usage
#### To use this example:

1. Open the Gpt3Example.java file in your preferred Java IDE.
2. Replace the <your-api-key> placeholder with your GPT-3 API key.
3. Replace the <your-engine-id> placeholder with your GPT-3 engine ID.
4. Modify the prompt and maxTokens variables to suit your needs.
- The prompt variable is a string that represents the text prompt to use when generating the text.
- The maxTokens variable is an integer that represents the maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.
5. Run the main method in the Main class.
6. The generated text should be printed to the console.
  
### Troubleshooting
  
If you encounter any issues while using this example, here are a few things to check:

- Make sure that you have replaced the `<your-api-key>` and `<your-engine-id>` placeholders with your actual API key and engine ID.
- Make sure that your API key and engine ID are valid.
- Make sure that your API key has permission to access the GPT-3 API.
- Make sure that your API key has not expired.
- Make sure that your internet connection is working properly.
- If you continue to experience issues, please refer to the GPT-3 API documentation or contact OpenAI support for further assistance.
